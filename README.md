Kadane's Algorithm to find Maximum Sum Subarray.
This problem, also known as Maximum Subarray Problem, is a very common question in a coding interview, and this gives the optimal answer.

```language
# kadanes algorithm to find max sum sub array

# input :-
    a array

# output :-
    max sub array

# Time complexity :-
    O(n) - linear time
    (normal bruteforce method takes O(n^2))

```
